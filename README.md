# Route_Handler_MVC_With_Php
This small system allows to manage routes for projects with the MVC pattern. It facilitates the management of routes by means of a special route file, avoiding the use of the URL itself to identify controllers, methods and parameters. All this is done from the routes folder.  -It was developed to streamline school projects that use this pattern.
